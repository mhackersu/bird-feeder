# Bird Feeder

                A golden service that instanciates a Go service via a roubust
                Dockerfile that fetches data from GCP data layer, performs
                standard deviation calculations, and outputs calculations as
                JSONL to the shell; Inputs are passed at instantiation for
                seamless service integration into a larger microservice cloud
                platform architecture.
