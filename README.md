# Go Feeder

                A Go service via Dockerfile that fetches data from GCP data layer,
                performs financial calculations, and outputs calculations as
                JSONL to the shell; Inputs are passed at instantiation for
                seamless service integration into a larger microservice cloud
                platform architecture.
